# Server Battery Monitoring

This repository contains a Node.js script that enables server battery monitoring. The script is designed to shut down your server when the battery percentage drops below a certain threshold and sends a notification on Discord when the percentage is low.

## Installation
To install and run the script, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/goodbyepavlyi/server-battery-monitoring
```

#### 2. Navigate to the source directory
```bash
cd server-battery-monitoring/src
```

#### 3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Run the script
```bash
node app.js
```

Please note that this script assumes compatibility with your server's operating system and availability of battery-related system commands or APIs. You may need to customize the script based on your server's specific setup and requirements.
